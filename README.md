Cost effectiveness analysis using Markov chains

This program runs a simple cost effectiveness analysis comparing two 
    strategies with three health states. It can be augmented to compare more 
    than two strategies and any number of health states. It should also be 
    noted that this program is a work in progress and was my first foray into 
    Python. So please let me know if there are any bugs or weird output.
